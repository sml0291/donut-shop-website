# Donut Shop Website

## Design Thinking Principles

1. Empathise – with your users
  - Colorful design (sprinkles, etc)
  - Donut photos
  - Price
2. Define – your users' needs, their problem, and your insights
  - Users needs: Users want to purchase donuts within few minutes and probably less than 10 touches/clicks (convenient, fast, easy)
  - Users needs: Users may want to check prices constantly (total price & discounted prices)
  - Users problems: The age of users can be various
  - My insights:  elderly groups may want bigger fonts and simpler steps. maybe creating a button, just like a dark mode on our zombie website.
3. Ideate – by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions
  - login provides a promotion point, which would give users free donuts
  - elders (proof required) above 65 would have 50% discount on every Tuesday
4. Prototype – to start creating solutions
  - Figma (address: )
5. Test – solutions
